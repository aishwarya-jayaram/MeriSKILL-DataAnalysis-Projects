1. DIABETES PREDICTION SYSTEM

This diabetes prediction system involves using Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for data visualization, seaborn for enhanced visualizations, and scikit-learn for machine learning tasks. The system utilizes the RandomForestClassifier algorithm to predict diabetes based on input features. It splits the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split, evaluates the model's performance using metrics like accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix, and roc_auc_score.

ABOUT DATASET:
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive
and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict
whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements
included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of
these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are
females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

COLUMN DESCRIPTION FOR DIABETES DATA:
• Pregnancies
• Glucose
• Blood Pressure
• Skin Thickness
• Insulin
• BMI
• Diabetes
• Age
• Outcome

2. HR ANALYTICS SYSTEM

The HR analytics system utilizes Python libraries like pandas for data handling, matplotlib for plotting, seaborn for enhanced visualizations, and scikit-learn for machine learning tasks. It employs Logistic Regression for analysis and StandardScaler for data normalization. The system visualizes correlations among various HR-related variables like Overtime, Marital Status, Job Role, Gender, Education Field, Department, and Business Travel. It also explores relationships between Overtime and Age, Total Working Years, Education Level, Number of Companies Worked, and Distance from Home to gain insights into HR trends and patterns.

• Education Field
• Department
• Business Travel
• Relation between Overtime and Age
• Total Working Year
• Education Level
